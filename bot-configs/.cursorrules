STRICT SECURITY RULES:
- Never generate real secrets, credentials, or API keys
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Never log sensitive information

CODING STANDARDS:
- Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
- Use Python 3.11+ with type hints for backend code  
- Follow PEP 8 for Python, Prettier for JS/TS
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Write clear, self-documenting code with comments for complex logic
- Add unit tests for all new functions

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite 5 for build tooling
- MUI v5 for UI components
- React Query for data fetching

Backend:
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Google Cloud Platform services
- BigQuery for data warehouse
- Cloud Run for containerized services

Infrastructure:
- Terraform 1.5+ for IaC
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Workload Identity Federation for auth

BEST PRACTICES:
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Implement proper error boundaries in React
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Use database transactions where appropriate
- Cache expensive operations with TTL

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- All endpoints must have authentication
- Use IAP for public-facing services
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate request schemas
- Sanitize database queries
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use Secret Manager for credentials
- Regular security dependency updates

DOCUMENTATION:
- Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI
- Include JSDoc/docstrings for functions
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document architectural decisions in ADRs
- Include examples in documentation

When generating code:
1. Consider security implications first
2. Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. Ensure code is testable and maintainable
4. Optimize for readability over cleverness
5. Include appropriate error handling
6. Add logging at key decision points
7. Consider performance implications
8. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

MCP + CLI FALLBACK STRATEGY:

MCP servers (GitHub, Fetch, Filesystem) are configured in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.
Not all agents have MCP access. Use this fallback strategy:

GitHub Operations (Priority Order):
1. MCP: Use GitHub MCP tools if available
2. CLI Fallback: Use `gh` CLI commands
   - List repos: gh repo list merglbot-core --limit 50 --json nameWithOwner
   - Get PR info: gh pr view 123 --repo merglbot-core/infra --json title,state,body
   - Create PR: gh pr create --title "feat: ..." --body "..."

Web Fetch Operations:
1. MCP: Use Fetch MCP tools if available
2. CLI Fallback: Use `curl`
   - curl -fsS https://www.merglbot.ai/health

GCP Operations (Always CLI):
GCP operations always use `gcloud` CLI (no MCP):
   - List projects: gcloud projects list --filter='projectId~"^merglbot-"'
   - Cloud Run status: gcloud run services list --project=merglbot-admin-prd --region=europe-west1

Agent Helper Scripts:
For complex operations, use the helper scripts in scripts/agent-helpers/:
   - ./scripts/agent-helpers/github-ops.sh list-all-orgs
   - ./scripts/agent-helpers/gcp-ops.sh health-check
See scripts/agent-helpers/README.md for full usage examples and the decision tree.

Agent Type Detection:
- If you have access to MCP tools → use them first
- If MCP fails or unavailable → use CLI equivalents
- NEVER get stuck - always have a CLI fallback plan
