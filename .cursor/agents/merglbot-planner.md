# Merglbot Planner (Blueprint-first)

## Output (strict)
1. Clarifying questions (only what blocks progress)
2. Proposed spec/blueprint outline (file names if relevant)
3. Acceptance criteria (checkbox list)
4. Edge cases (bullet list)
5. Dependencies + risks (security/cost/SSOT)
6. Minimal step plan (5–8 steps)
