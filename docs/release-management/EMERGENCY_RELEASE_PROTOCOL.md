# Emergency Release Protocol

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for executing emergency releases (hotfixes) when critical issues are discovered in production that require immediate remediation.

## When to Trigger an Emergency Release

### Criteria for Emergency Release

An emergency release should be triggered when:

1. **Critical Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Active exploitation detected
   - Zero-day vulnerabilities
   - Exposed sensitive data or credentials
   - Authentication/authorization bypass

2. **Complete Service Outage**
   - Primary services unavailable
   - Database corruption
   - Critical data loss
   - Payment processing failures

3. **Severe Data Integrity Issues**
   - Incorrect calculations affecting financial data
   - Data corruption spreading
   - GDPR/compliance violations

4. **Major Performance Degradation**
   - Response times >10x normal
   - System resources exhausted
   - Cascading failures

## Emergency Release Team

### Core Team Roles

| Role | Primary | Backup | Contact |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Incident Commander | @[primary-ic] | @[backup-ic] | [phone/slack] |
| Release Manager | @[primary-rm] | @[backup-rm] | [phone/slack] |
| Lead Developer | @[primary-dev] | @[backup-dev] | [phone/slack] |
| QA Lead | @[primary-qa] | @[backup-qa] | [phone/slack] |
| DevOps Engineer | @[primary-ops] | @[backup-ops] | [phone/slack] |
| Communications Lead | @[primary-comm] | @[backup-comm] | [phone/slack] |

### Escalation Path

```
Level 1 (0-15 min): On-call engineer
Level 2 (15-30 min): Team lead + Release manager
Level 3 (30-60 min): Engineering manager + CTO
Level 4 (60+ min): CEO + Board notification
```

## Emergency Release Process

### Phase 1: Assessment (0-15 minutes)

1. **Incident Detection**
   ```bash
   # Create incident channel
   /incident create [DESCRIPTION]
   
   # Alert team
   @here Emergency detected: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
   ```

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - [ ] Identify affected services
   - [ ] Estimate user impact
   - [ ] Determine data at risk
   - [ ] Check if rollback is viable

3. **Decision Point**
   - **Can rollback?** ‚Üí Execute rollback procedure
   - **Need hotfix?** ‚Üí Continue to Phase 2
   - **Can wait?** ‚Üí Schedule regular release

### Phase 2: Preparation (15-30 minutes)

1. **Create Hotfix Branch**
   ```bash
   # From production tag
   git checkout -b hotfix/[ISSUE-ID] v[CURRENT_PRODUCTION_VERSION]
   ```

2. **Implement Fix**
   - [ ] Write minimal fix (no refactoring)
   - [ ] Add regression test
   - [ ] Update version (patch increment)
   - [ ] Create PR with "HOTFIX:" prefix

3. **Fast-track Review**
   - Minimum 1 reviewer (2 preferred)
   - Focus on fix effectiveness
   - Security review if applicable

### Phase 3: Testing (10-15 minutes)

1. **Minimal Test Suite**
   ```bash
   # Run critical path tests only
   npm run test:critical
   
   # Run security scan
   npm run security:scan
   
   # Smoke test in staging
   ./scripts/smoke-test.sh staging
   ```

2. **Staging Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to staging
   gcloud run deploy [SERVICE] \
     --image=[HOTFIX_IMAGE] \
     --region=[REGION] \
     --project=[STAGING_PROJECT]
   ```

3. **Validation Checklist**
   - [ ] Original issue resolved
   - [ ] No new critical issues
   - [ ] Performance acceptable
   - [ ] Logs clean

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (10-15 minutes)

1. **Pre-deployment**
   ```bash
   # Backup current state
   ./scripts/backup-production.sh
   
   # Notify stakeholders
   ./scripts/notify-emergency-release.sh
   ```

2. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Blue-green deployment
   gcloud run deploy [SERVICE] \
     --image=[HOTFIX_IMAGE] \
     --region=[REGION] \
     --project=[PROD_PROJECT] \
     --tag=hotfix-[TIMESTAMP]
   
   # Gradual traffic shift
   gcloud run services update-traffic [SERVICE] \
     --to-tags=hotfix-[TIMESTAMP]=10
   ```

3. **Progressive Rollout**
   ```
   T+0min: 10% traffic
   T+5min: 25% traffic (if healthy)
   T+10min: 50% traffic (if healthy)
   T+15min: 100% traffic (if healthy)
   ```

### Phase 5: Verification (5-10 minutes)

1. **Health Checks**
   ```bash
   # Service health
   curl -f https://[SERVICE]/health
   
   # Metrics check
   ./scripts/check-metrics.sh --service=[SERVICE]
   
   # Error rate check
   ./scripts/check-errors.sh --threshold=1%
   ```

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - [ ] Error rates normal
   - [ ] Response times acceptable
   - [ ] No new alerts
   - [ ] User complaints resolved

### Phase 6: Post-Deployment (15-30 minutes)

1. **Documentation**
   ```markdown
   ## Hotfix Release [VERSION]
   - Issue: [DESCRIPTION]
   - Impact: [USER IMPACT]
   - Fix: [WHAT WAS CHANGED]
   - Deployed: [TIMESTAMP]
   - Verified: [TIMESTAMP]
   ```

2. **Communication**
   - [ ] Update status page
   - [ ] Send all-clear to stakeholders
   - [ ] Update incident ticket
   - [ ] Schedule post-mortem
